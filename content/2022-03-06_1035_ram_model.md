# Random Access Machine Model

In a RAM instructions are sequential (one after the other, only one thing at a time) and we assume constant time to access memory.

In the early days of computing the RAM model wasn't true. E.g. they used tapes, memory locations at the end of the tape took longer to read than at the start. In modern computers it's also not true because they have memory hierarchy. Different layers of memory like L1 & L2 caches etc/registers/RAM/disks etc that have different access speeds. Also in modern computers some things happen in parrallel rather than sequential.

For most of the time, the RAM model is sufficiently accurate that we can use it to determine the effiency of a program. It's quite good for understanding algorithms but it has limits.
