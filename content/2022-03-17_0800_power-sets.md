# Power Sets

What is a [power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set)? A power set is a set of all the subsets of a set. This includes the empty set. The largest subset is all of the items. And then every other combination of sets.

A power set will have `2**n` sets in it, where n is the number of items in the original set.
