# Memory Hierarchy

Memory that is fast and close to the CPU is a lot faster than memory that is far away and large. But in general memory is a lot slower than the processor. See [[2022-03-11_2010_process-memory-gap]]

Note, different types of devices, like servers versus desktops versus mobiles can have slightly different memory hierarchies.
