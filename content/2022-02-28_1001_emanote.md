# Emanote

[Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/) is a haskell static note generator for zettlekasen.

It uses markdown.

It produces a 'Links to this page' at the footer of every note. This is autopopulated with backreferences to other pages that link to this page.

[[2022-02-28_1000_zettelkasen|zettelkasen]] is a note-taking system that is based on links to other notes and tags. So Emanote allows linking with `[[filename]]`. But how does it do tags?

Ah:

> Add Twitter-like hashtags anywhere in Markdown file. They can also be added to the YAML frontmatter. Hash tags can also be “hierarchical”, for instance: `#emanote/syntax/demo`

So #zettelkasen produces a tag as does #emanote. Pretty cool.

You can link to other notes by placing the filename (without extension) inside double square bracket `[[2022-02-28_1000_zettelkasen]]`. You can control the present of the name by writing using a bar `[[2022-02-28_1000_zettelkasen|zettelkasen]]`
