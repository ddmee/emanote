# Alan Kay Power of Simplicity

Rough notes from [a talk Alan Kay gave to SAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdSD07U5uBs)

[Alan Kay's wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay)

Most problems come out of the current context. Don't try to solve those problems. It's a bad heuristic.

Instead you want to find the worthwhile problems to solve. The problems that cut across the existing problems.

For example, 20th century context is a lot like gears. Everything is tightly bound. The interfaces are very carefully constructed to match and interact with each other. The problem is a machine with gears has an upperlimit of about 1000 gears before it seises-up. You can't get the tolerance high enough.

Sound like software?

A future context would be a leap forward. Towards a biological context. When you go to biological we have a hundred trillion cells in our body. Apparently only about 10% of the cells in our body has our DNA in it. The other 90% of cells are 'slime', other things like bacteria, ecoli etc. Apparently there's about 25,000 forms of other micro-organisms inside our body. Most of which we don't know what they do for us. This 'other' 90% of cells in our body are physically smaller than the 10% of our own cells. The other cells physically is about the size of a basketball.

The point is we haven't yet made anything that has as many parts as our own body.

The internet is maybe the closest thing. It never has really broken. It's run continously since it was created. It's parts have been replaced many times over. It's self organising. Control isn't centralised. Quite a lot like how Bezos at Amazon thought more communication between parts of the company wouldn't scale and was inefficient and a sign of bad opertions. He wanted the parts of the company to be able to act independently without having to communicate much.

Most companies or institutions, people expect someone to be in charge. But this has problems when the institution tries to grow. Centralised control can make growth difficult.

Can't think of incremental changes if you want leap forwards. Question: what would be ridiculous not to have in 30 years? 

He's basically making the case for the fairly unconstrainted research centres like xerox park. Where researchers are given the time to research the future without having to justify incremental or short-term improvements.

Don't know if Kay is right about the reasons for productivity at xerox park. It might be just that group were among the first to stumble across the green virgin field of electronics and computing and so the inventions they came up with where nearly obvious. It might be the underlying tech shift had happened and they where just in the right place at the right time.

Kay's [Viewpoint Research Institute](http://vpri.org) that he talked about in this [2007 discussion at CMU](https://youtu.be/PFc379hu--8) seems to have 'concluded'. Interesting it was combined with #ycombinator in 2016 apparently.

He has some idea about improvements need to reach a basic threshold before they can be appreciated. A bit like Peter Thiels complaint that 'Minimum Viable Product' is a broken idea.
