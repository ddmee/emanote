# Clustering

![[2022-03-17_0858_red-blue-dots-3.png]]

Clustering means organisation the points or objects in groups that are similar in some way. For example, if you buy a book on Amazon, they can use clustering to group books bought together as similar, helping to recommend other books to buy. Likewise, you can use clustering to find genes that look the same in genetics. Etc etc.

What does similar mean? Perhaps it means grouping by height, or by weight. It depends what similarity feature we're interested in.

## objective function

Clustering can be defined as an [[2022-03-16_1635_optimisation-problems|optimisation problem]]:

- It should have low intra-cluster dissimilarity. And; (the clusters are far apart)
- It should have high inter-cluster similarity. (the points within the cluster are closely together.)

How do we calculate similarity of points within a cluster? Well, we want to calculate the variance, which is the sum of all the elememnts in the cluster minus the element squared.

```
Variance(C) = Sum [of All X in C] (mean(C) - X)**2

Where C is the cluster, X is an element in C.
```

We can use a similar method to calculate the distance between two cluters.

## Constraints

What about the constraint of the problem? Perhaps we say there's a maximum number of clusters. Or perhaps we say we want there to be a maximum distance between clusters.

In general solving this problem is computationally prohibitive. So we tend to use [[2022-03-16_1704_greedy-algorithm|greedy algorithms]] to solve this. Algorithms that are commonly used include:

- [[2022-03-17_1019_k-means-clustering]] = we want exactly K clusters
- [[2022-03-17_1020_hierarchical-clustering]] = seeks to build a hierachy of clusters.

## Comparing multiple characteristics of the data

See [[2022-03-21_0813_feature-vector], which often brings about a requirement to do scaling. See [[2022-03-21_0816_scaling-normalisation]]. And a worked example: [[2022-03-21_0903_clustering-mammals-example]].

## Note

See [[2022-03-17_0840_machine-learning]] for a supervised approach to classifying the dots.
