# Why encrypted email sucks

[Blog post here](https://latacora.micro.blog/2020/02/19/stop-using-encrypted.html) describing it's shortcomings and the conclusion - don't use it.

Perhaps must enjoyable it describe encrypted email as 'LARP'ing. People just pretending and playing at secure communications.

Note, not encrypted email chains, if they go on long enough, will have someone reply unecrypted with often all the previous emails in the chain in plain text. lol
