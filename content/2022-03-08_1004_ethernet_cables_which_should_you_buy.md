# Ethernet cabling which should you buy? 2022

[Youtuber SpaceRex has a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Us80Dvu3EA) describing the different CAT categories of cabling.

Cat 5E has been the standard cabling for some time. It's flexible, cheap, widely available. Is your typical 1 gbps cabling, can do up to 2.5gbps.

Cat 6 IEEE standard from 2001. It's got better cross-talk reduction than Cat 5e. It can carry 10gbps up to 55m.

Cat 6A is stiffer than Cat 6, it can carry 10gbps up to 100m. It's more expensive and harder to find than Cat 6 in my experience. It's not really neccessary, harder to cable because of it's stiffness.

> "Cat6A cable is made and terminated to tighter tolerances than Cat6. This means the copper conductors are twisted tighter. This requires higher specification patch panels, wall jacks, and RJ45 connectors."

From Cable Academy [Cat6 vs Cat6a](https://www.truecable.com/blogs/cable-academy/cat6-vs-cat6a)

Cat 7 isn't really a standard, it was a proprietary development to get fast speeds. Wasn't a proper IEEE standard.

Cat 8 is very bulky and for 10Gbps speeds and over (up to 40Gbps)). It's not really useful for home networking as it's very stiff to work with, expensive, and such fast networking equipment isn't available at a reasonable price. Standard only came over 2016.

## Which should you buy in 2022?

Probably Cat6 as it's more widely available than Cat6A, easier to route. You could still use Cat 5E if you don't intend to ever use 10gbps on the wiring. But if you think you might want to upgrade at some point in the future to 10gbps networking without rewiring then Cat 6 it is. Cat7 and 8 aren't worthwhile.

Cable Academy seems to recommend Cat6A over Cat6 in [Cat6 vs Cat6a](https://www.truecable.com/blogs/cable-academy/cat6-vs-cat6a) but when you look at it's breakdown, it's really recommending Cat6 unless you need the full 100m distance.

Personally I can find a lot more options for purchasing Cat6 cable than Cat6A in 2022.
