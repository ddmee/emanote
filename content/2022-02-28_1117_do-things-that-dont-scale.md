# Do things that don't scale

A lot of #start-up or #business-advice often point to Paul Grahams [Do things that Don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html)

That seems to include advice like not worrying about creating that can't handle large traffic or seem like crummy solutions. E.g.g From on eigilsagafos's comment on [Ask HN: What made your business take off that you wish you'd done much earlier?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30329762)

> Me and my two co-founders are asking ourselves this all the time, and in retrospect every strategic change could have happened sooner if we had learnt faster and kept “doing things that don’t scale” as PG famously wrote years ago. The funny thing is that we think we are doing great in that regard only to realize again and again that we have to iterate faster and stop the urge to prematurely optimize for scale.

>Our latest learning that we retrospectively should have seen earlier is to get rid of our fear of becoming consultants. We come from a consultancy background and have seen to many startups around us wanting to build products, but taking on consultancy assignments leaving them no time to build their product. We have been so determined not to fall into that trap, realizing now that we have missed out on some great opportunities when selling to enterprises.
