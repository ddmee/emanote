# Bubble Sort, aka sinking sort

> Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

Good diagram of the routine from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#/media/File:Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif):

Python code:

```python

def bubble_sort(l:list) -> list:
    # in place sort
    length = len(l) - 1
    if length < 1:  # no elements in list or only 1 element in the list
        return l
    ptr1, ptr2 = 0, 1
    is_sorted = True
    while True:
        if l[ptr2] < l[ptr1]:  # swap the elements
            inter2, inter1 = l[ptr2], l[ptr1]
            l[ptr1], l[ptr2] = inter2, inter1
            is_sorted = False  # mark list as not yet sorted

        if ptr2 == length:
            if is_sorted is True:
                break
            else:
                is_sorted = True
            ptr1, ptr2 = 0, 1 # time to go back to the start of the list
        else:
            ptr1 += 1
            ptr2 += 1

    return l

```

What's the worst case? The worst case is the smallest number is at the end of the list. E.g. `bubble_sort([2,3,4,1])`. Because, the algorithm will only move the smallest number one place to the left every iteration, and there are 4 iterations required.

So, for every new element in the list, you would have to do another iteration. But also, in every iteration, you have to compare every element against the element beside it, which is means comparing operation occurs length of the list times at each iteration.

So, (length of list) * (length of list), which is `Order(length(list)**2)`

Thus it's a quadratic growth curve. Which sucks.

Another way you can tell this from the implementation above is that it's a nested loop, one loop inside another loop. Which is number of elements squared operations to complete.
