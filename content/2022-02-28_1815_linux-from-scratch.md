# Linux from Scratch

[Linux From Scratch](https://linuxfromscratch.org) is a tutorial on how to compile and build your own #linux distribution.

The latest stable release of the book is [here](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/)

Though [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/15/arch_linux_20/) recommends installing [[2022-03-15_1626_arch-linux]] first before LFS.
