# Factorial

## Standard, loop based

```python
def f(n):  # calculates factorial
    assert n >= 0
    answer = 1
    while n > 1:
        answer *= n
        n -= 1
    return answer
```

## Recursive factorial

This method of calculating factorial calls `fact()` n times. So it's runs in O(n) time. Which is the same as the non-recursive version above.

```python
def fact(n):
    assert n >= 0
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return n*fact(n - 1)
```
