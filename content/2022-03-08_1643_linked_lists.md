# Linked List

## Fixed size lists, offsets are efficient as indexes

If you have a list of elements of a fixed size, say a list of ints, where ints are all 2 units of memory, you can index into any element in the list if you know the starting position of the list in memory. The formula is a simple: `position = starting location + (no. of units allocated per element) * index`.

## The linked list

But what if you have a list of elements where the size isn't fixed? For example, in python, lists can contain anything. How would you lookup the elements?

Well, one way is the [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list). Probably the oldest implementation of a list of variably sized elements. In fact it was invented at [IBM in 1953](https://iq.opengenus.org/inventor-of-linked-list/) and was associated with the [Turing Award of 1975](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award).

In a linked list every element is a pointer to the next value and then the value itself.

> "a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. ...This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration... The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory or on disk...On the other hand, since simple linked lists by themselves do not allow random access to the data or any form of efficient indexing"

From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)

Main benefits:

- items do not need to be in contiguous memory locations
- can remove or insert elements into the list by alterting the links (pointers) rather than having to copy and shift entire continous memory contents like a traditional array.

**Q:How do you know the size of the element in a linked list?** It looks like the pointer just points to the next element. Maybe they aren't used for variable sized elements? You'd also need another section in the element saying how large the value is. Or you could use a null byte to terminate the elements memory section. Yeah presumably there's a few schemes depending on the programming language.

This is a 'singley' linked list, in that you can only iterate the elements from the start to the end. You traverse forward but cannot traverse as backwards so easily.

## Double linked list

A 'doubley' linked list is where each element in the list has two pointers and the value. One pointer points to the next element, the other pointer points to the previous element. Thus you can traverse backwards or forwards.

## Iteration cost of a linked list, indexing

To find the I(th) element of a linked list, you have to step through every single element's pointer. Thus, it's `O(i)` where i is the number of elements in the list. That's a linear cost compared with the number of elements in the list, which isn't great.

This isn't good for [[2022-03-06_1050_binary-search]] which is  `O(log2(length(list)))` log base 2 of length of the list, because binary search looks up elements in the list in the algorithm and would expect constant look-up time. Which is true for fixed size lists but not variable sized links lists. Thus the lookup is actually slower than the binary chop.

## Dynamic arrays - indexing are efficient for variable sized elements

An improvement to produce a constant look-up for variable elements is called a [[2022-03-08_1726_dynamic-array]].
