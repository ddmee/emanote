# Greedy Algorithms

Iterative algorithm, at each step pick the locally optimal solution.

This means we must have a way of knowing what the **locally optimal** choice is at each iteration.

See [[2022-03-16_1709_greedy-knapsack-algorithm]] for a greedy algorithm to solve the knapsack problem.

Greedy algorithms can provide optimal solutions but not always.

Greedy algorithms are typically *linear* or *log-linear* run-times. Thus they are relatively quick solutions.

The general problem is that for some problems a sequence of locally optimal solutions will not produce a good guess at a globally optimal solution.
