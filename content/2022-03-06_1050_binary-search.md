# Binary Search

Improvement over [2022-03-06_1045_linear-search] provided list is sorted.

Binary search, where the input is reduced in half each iteration (thus binary, because split in two halves, throwing away one half per iteration). Halving the input everytime means the growth increases by 1 iteration as input doubles. I.e. 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 elements etc. (Note here it's the growth of the length of the list we care about) So the growth rate the inverse of `n**2` which is `O(log2(length(n)))` log base 2 of length of n:

```python
def bSearch(L, e, low, high):
    if high - low < 2:
        return L[low] == e or L[high] == e
    mid = low + int((high - low)/2)
    if L[mid] == e:
        return True
    if L[mid] > e:
        return bSearch(L, e, low, mid - 1)
    else:
        return bSearch(L, e, mid + 1, high)


def search(L, e):
    return bSearch(L, e, 0, len(L) - 1)
```

Note binary search requires an order list as input. We are ignoring here the cost of sorting the list from the cost of the algorithm.

And of course the other thing is this complexity calculation assumes that accessing the list elements like `L[mid]` is constant which depends on the programming language providing that feature.
