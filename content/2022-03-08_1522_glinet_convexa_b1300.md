# Glinet Convexa B1300

- [Flash Layout](https://openwrt.org/toh/gl.inet/gl-b1300#flash_layout) described.
- 32MB [Serial Peripheral Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) (SPI) flash chip
- 256MB RAM
- System-on-Chip (SOC) Qualcomm Atheros IPQ4028
- Optional 802.3at [[PoE|2022-03-07_1908_power_over_ethernet]] power

Interesting to note the RAM is bigger than the flash. And the layout does correspond to the description of rooters at [[2022-03-07_1543_how-routers-boot]]. You'd think that flash is cheaper than RAM. But obviously if you can compress the firmware, you can get away with smaller flash requirements.

[Wikicat has an entry for the unit](https://wikidevi.wi-cat.ru/GL.iNet_GL-B1300)

Wikicat has a link to the [FCC's listing on the unit](https://fcc.io/2AFIW/-B1300). Which includes lots of very good information including internal pictures and schematics. In fact, the information on the FCC has is more fullsome than what Gl-inet supplies on it's own website.

And [openwrt itself](https://openwrt.org/toh/gl.inet/gl-b1300) has a good entry for the unit. Including how to open the case.

And there [firmware API documentation here](https://dev.gl-inet.com). There seems to be a [built-in REST API](https://dev.gl-inet.com/api/) on the unit.

The only thing I can't get, which would be nice, is the PCB schematics.
