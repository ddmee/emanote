# Ethernet Shielded v Unshielded Cabling

If there's situations with electro-magnetic interference, then you might need to use shielded cabling. However, shielded cabling needs to be effectively grounded. Plus, tends to be stiffer/more expensive because it requires running shielded inside the cable. For most domestic situations, unshielded cabling should be sufficient.

There are a few different types of shielding. Codes are used to demark them.

| Code     | Meaning (outer layer cable/ inner cables)     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
|  U/UTP   | Unshielded/ unshield Twisted Pair             |
|  F/UTP   | Foil shielded/ unshielded twisted pairs       |
|  S/UTP   | Sscreen shielded/ unshielded twisted pairs    |
|  F/FTP   | Foil shielded/ foil shielded twisted pairs    |
|  S/FTP   | Screen shielded/ foil shielded twisted pairs  |
|  SF/UTP  | Foil and Screen/ unshielded Twisted Pair      |
|  SF/FTP  | Foil and Screen/ foil shielded twisted Pair   |


Foil shielded: an aluminum foil shield (screen) around the entire cable, beneath the jacket.

For foil-shielded twisted pairs: each individual twisted pair is also wrapped in a foil shield.

Screen shielded also known as braid-shielded: an aluminum braided shield (screen) around the entire cable, beneath the jacket. The braided shield offers better protection from RFI, better grounding, and greater mechanical strength than the foil shield alone.


Note:

> “U/UTP” is often shortened to “UTP,” and “F/UTP” is often shown instead as “FTP.” More often, shielded networking cable is referred to generically as “STP”, regardless of how the cable is shielded. This is a possible point of confusion, especially for those new to the trade.
