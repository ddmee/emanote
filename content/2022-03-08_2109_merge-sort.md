# Merge Sort

[Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) is still the one of the most  popular sorting algorithm even though it was invented back in the the 1940s.

Von Neumann observed: Given two sorted lists, you can merge them quickly.

As in, you can just walk through both lists at the same time (two pointers). Can compare current item in list one with current item in list two. Whichever is smallest, you put into your new merged, sorted list.

Merging two sorted lists is thus requires length of the list comparisons. So, `O(len(list))` which is linear growth.

So, to merge sort, you take the original list, break it up so you have a bunch of lists of length 1 (each list is then 'sorted'). Then you merge pairs of those lists together. Produces sorted lists of length two. Then merge pairs of those lists together, etc. Until you're back to the full sorted list.

How many times will this algorithm call merge? Answer: `log(base 2)(length(list)).`

So, it's that many merges multipled by the cost of merging. Which is: `log(len(list))*len(list)` or `O(len(list)*log(len(list))`. If `n=len(list)`, then we say: `O(nlog(n))`

```python

def merge(left, right, lt):
    """Assumes left and right are sorted lists.
     lt defines an ordering on the elements of the lists.
     Returns a new sorted(by lt) list containing the same elements
     as (left + right) would contain."""
    result = []
    i,j = 0, 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if lt(left[i], right[j]):
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    while (i < len(left)):
        result.append(left[i])
        i += 1
    while (j < len(right)):
        result.append(right[j])
        j += 1
    return result

def sort(L, lt = lambda x,y: x < y):
    """Returns a new sorted list containing the same elements as L"""
    if len(L) < 2:
        return L[:]
    else:
        middle = int(len(L)/2)
        left = sort(L[:middle], lt)
        right = sort(L[middle:], lt)
        return merge(left, right, lt)
