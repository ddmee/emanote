# Process-Memory Performance Gap

CPU speeds increased expontentially while memory speeds increased at a slower pace. This performance gap is termed the process-memory gap. CPU instructions are quick whereas fetching data from RAM has become expensive.

This lead to the development of L1/L2/L3 caches. Which are not registers but very fast memory cache layers close to the CPU that can be accessed much faster than RAM.
