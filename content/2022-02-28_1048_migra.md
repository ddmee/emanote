[Migra](https://github.com/djrobstep/migra) is a #database diffing tool.

[Page describing how it's useful](https://djrobstep.com/talks/your-migrations-are-bad-and-you-should-feel-bad) versus writing #migrations with a tool like #alembic

Seems that you can just keep a single file describe your described current/golden schema. Keep that in version control. Then when you want to change your production database to match that schema, you can run migra to produce a diff. Then use the diff output to alter the database.

I wonder how it works to transform data. Say you're database schema has incompatible or differing data from the old schema. How will it suggest to transform the data?

Anyway, seems like it might be a better method than run traditional migrations.
