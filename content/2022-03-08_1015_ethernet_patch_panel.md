# Ethernet Patch Panel

A patch panel provides a way to fix ethernet wires into a panel. This allows you to wire up the physical space/building, terminating all the ethernet cables into the patch panel.

This provides a central place to terminate the ethernet cables, before you then connect the ports to other networking equipment.
