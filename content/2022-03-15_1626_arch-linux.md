# Arch Linux

[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)is a do-it yourself linux.

According to [*The Register*](https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/15/arch_linux_20/)

> The documentation is exceptionally good ...
>
> The installation process, and the documentation behind it, lead to the third virtue: a complete installation tends to be very small and simple, because you only install the bits you need. If you don't know what bits you need, the documentation will help you to work it out, and the result is something that is both fairly minimal and that, with luck, you understand. You know what's in there because you installed it.
