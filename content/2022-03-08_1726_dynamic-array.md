# Dynamic Array

[Wiki: Dynamic Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array)

Provides an implementation of a variable sized elements in a list, while maintaining constant look-up time. As an improvement over the [[2022-03-08_1643_linked_lists.]]

Uses indirection, by having an array of pointers, the pointers point to the individual elements of the list. Thus indexing is constant because i(th) element of a list is accessed by the calculatable offset to get the appropriate pointer and then going to value pointed to.

This is how [CPython implements the list](https://www.laurentluce.com/posts/python-list-implementation/)

I wonder how does implementation deal with specifying the memory size of the value pointed to?
