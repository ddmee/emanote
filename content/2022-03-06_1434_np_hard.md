# NP Complete NP Hard Problems

Exponential and factorial time algorithms, see [[2022-03-06_1040_graphs_of_growth]], are impractical except for very small input sizes. However, there are a class of problems, called **NP-complete** problems, that require exponential or factorial algorithms to solve fully.

Basically, if you know the problem is NP-complete, trying to find an optimal solution that isn't exponential is fighting the nearly impossible.

In fact, there's a price from Clay Mathematics Institute for $1 million to the first person who can find a non-exponential algorithm to a NP-complete problem. In fact, it's been proven that a non-exponential algorithm for *any* NP-complete problem can be generalised to *all* NP-complete problems.
