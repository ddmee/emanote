# Codeforces

[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com) "is a project joining people interested in and taking part in programming contests. On one hand, Codeforces is a social network dedicated to programming and programming contests. On the other hand, it is a platform where contests are held regularly, the participant's skills are reflected by their rating and the former contests can be used to prepare".

[Catalogue section](https://codeforces.com/catalog) is particularly helpful.

I came across codeforces from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAeiXy8-9Y8).

He links to a book called [[2022-03-04_2043_competitive-programming-handbook|Competitive Programming Handbook]] that seems very good.

The site is perhaps a better version of [[2022-02-28_1054_leetcode]] in that it's full of competitive programmers, questions and solutions.
